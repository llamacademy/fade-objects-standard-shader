A common problem with top-down games is objects can block line of sight to the player, resulting in a less-than optimal experience for the player because they can get lost or confused. Using this technique you can resolve this problem and make a better experience for your players by fading out objects that block line of sight to any object while still using the Unity Standard Shader!

I use this exact same technique in my game!
